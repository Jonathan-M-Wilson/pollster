# Pollster App (Django Crash Course)

> Python Django app to create polls with questions/choices

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Pollster is a basic poll application. This project is based on the tutorial [Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/) from the official Django docs. This was a personal exploration of Django to kick start a more indepth journey into the python / django world. 

## Quick Start

``` zsh
# Install dependencies
pipenv install

cd pollster

# Serve on localhost:8000
python manage.py runserver
```
